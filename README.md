# Demo Flutter app Using Bloc architect
## Overview
Currently, there are 3 screens:

 1. **Barcode Scanning Screen**: only contains a button, allowing user to scan a Barcode or QRcode.
 2. **Signing Up Screen**: where user input username and password for signing up
 3. **User Info Screen**: 
		 - displays Barcode/QRcode from screen (1) and username info from screen (2)
		 - capture images with GPS exif (*not implemented*) 
		 - delete captured images (*not implemented*) 
		 - sign out and re-register

## Flow
